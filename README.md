## About

Algorithmist is an open source, educational website for coders.  We are building a community where you can learn and sharpen your data structure skills.  Data structures and algorithms can be difficult, so learning in a community can be one of the best ways to master these techniques.
<br/><br/>
## Tech Stack
This project is created with MERN stack.  A few third party APIs and services are used, such as the Google Spread Sheet APIs, Firebase for deployment, and Heroku for the backend.

Frontend hosted on Firebase : https://algorithmist-dev.web.app/

API hosted on Render : https://algorithmist-api.onrender.com/
